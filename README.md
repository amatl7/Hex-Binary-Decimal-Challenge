# Hex-Binary-Decimal-Challenge
Create a hexadecimal, decimal, and binary converter in C++ without using any variables, loops, or most standard library functions.

When running via the command line first choose what is being converted h | b | d then choose what to convert it to h | b | d and then enter the value.

Exampels:
./hex.out h b a95
./hex.out b d 1000011
./hex.out d h 3579
